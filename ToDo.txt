1) fix the food shortage bug. how to deal with this when everyone can't even hunt for food because too many are building or run out of hunter space? or people are busy building buildings.

2) finished research - add icon/number that you can hover over for a tooltip? 

3) add some new goal like a total population (the coucil has decided to improve planning, reduce cost ratios of all buildings
then you can add an explorers guild next to the town hall - rename Town Hall tab?
- discover a coal mine
- discover iron mine (adding mines changes the ratio of cu/fe/coal output by the miners so that a given miner, say, produces less cu_ore but now produces some fe_ore

4) city planning should add smaller, winding dirt streets through the previously built areas, and nice grid smaller streets for new buildings that aren't shacks, woodsheds, lumberyards, quarry, etc.

5) make it so that adding research does not make messages, but it should log - change addResearchButton and the early reserches to not use logStatement().

6) consider renaming workshops (building) or workshops (job box). otherwise need to limit kilns to number of workshops and that is silly. Can make the 
[building]Workshop -> mason shop or stone-yard (still applies to brickmakers)
job box is till workshops
will add building smithy
kilns will be in their own building (smelt?)


7) tech to reduce all cost ratios

12) have a way to store more food and get more people (cabin for families to move into - kids number to Camp box (they eat less food and don't do jobs/do other easy jobs)

13) implement coal and iron mines

14) make kilns be able to select which metals are smelted 

15) add in trading for gold and other resources - later add in gold mine but not until after the market is set up

16) need some distant insentive that will require research -> want more researchers -> need more income -> need more workers -> need more houses

17) have explorers need to venture away from the river and need to carry water in clay pots. when the party leave, the pots get reduced. no need to have water as a resource. all of the food should be used but party returns about 90% of other resources. (%chance to lose a given resource so you can sometimes lose wagons). some of the random chance josh talked about.

Thoughts from Matt G:
make loadGame() auto-run on page load, and add auto-save - maybe every 5 minutes
fix tabs:
  make jobs constant
  switch between other stuff in second panel, make currently-selected tab highlighted
 not calling .toFixed(1) somewhere for resource updates, and need to use it on lumberworker tooltip
 gray out building if not enough resources
 


Thoughts from Christine:
Pottery
more storage (food, wood, lumber) - maybe increase warehouse space? add silos.
ok on people
wants to explore more


Thoughts from Matt C:
Make unlocking woodshed more straightforward 
Map that shows buildings (learn Canvas API?) - function to draw a new block 


Thoughts from Nacho:
have a way to lose stuff
need to fights someone
little animations to show workers


Thoughs from Mitch:



Thoughts from Brian:
Gold, trading

Thoughts from Josh L:
let buildings get destroyed 
random disasters
