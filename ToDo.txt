1) fix the food shortage bug. maybe make current workers abandon buildings and start hunting? how to deal with this when everyone can't even hunt for food because too many are building or run out of hunter space?

2) add option to minimize/hide research buttons - transiton into a small size with an icon/number that you can 
hover over for a tooltip?

3) add some new goal like a total population (the coucil has decided that once the town reaches X people they will attempt to start exploring and mapping the surrounding area)

then you can add an explorers guild next to the town hall - rename Town Hall tab?
explorer missions first few to discover places to make more resrouces - can add jobs to fields or forest - discover a coal mine

4) add resources and jobs for metal ores and smelting
