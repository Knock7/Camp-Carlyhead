1) make a document fragment of nodes for each new job box that I can copy with object.create() and then change values, 
or a constructor that takes the values for name of workers, etc

code could have function createJob(...array)

function addJob(the box to put it in) ie. Forest, Workshop
this will append the fragment to the right spot in the html - how does this work on loading a saved game?

make a similar constructor for new buildings

it may be best to just have all of the Stuff, Jobs, Buildings objects planned and listed out litterally after all? Yes! have
all of the values for them stored and access them when making the elements show up in the html. Dont' need to clutter the html 
with stuff i'm going to make anyway but need all the data about the properties listed out somewhere at the start.


////code start

var JobBox = documentFragment;

var make = 'whatever job is next'

var newBox = Object.create(JobBox)

newBox.firstchild // na I think I should build it up instead of copying and changing parts - try both ways


var newNode = new DocumentFragment();

newNode.addChild

newBox.getElementById





2) make research items look better and add option to minimize/hide them - transiton into a small size with an icon/number that you can 
hover over for a tooltip

3) add some goal like a total population (the coucil has decided that once the town reaches X people they will attempt to start exploring and mapping the surrounding area)
then you can add an explorers guild next to the town hall - rename Town Hall tab?
explorer missions first few to discover places to make more resrouces - can add jobs to fields or forest - discover a coal mine

4) add resources and jobs for metal ores and smelting

5) add a log for statements with a dropdown tab
