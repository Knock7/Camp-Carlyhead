1) add tooltips for workers (how much stuff they make). 
With current factor=0.5 and game tick 200ms it will be (make value)*0.5*(1000/200) or (make value)*2.5

2) make research items look better and add option to minimize/hide them - transiton into a small size with an icon/number that you can 
hover over for a tooltip

3) add some new goal like a total population (the coucil has decided that once the town reaches X people they will attempt to start exploring and mapping the surrounding area)

then you can add an explorers guild next to the town hall - rename Town Hall tab?
explorer missions first few to discover places to make more resrouces - can add jobs to fields or forest - discover a coal mine

4) add resources and jobs for metal ores and smelting

5) add a log for statements with a dropdown tab
