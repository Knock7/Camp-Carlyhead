1) fix the food shortage bug. maybe make current workers abandon buildings and start hunting

1.5) move the Buildings[buildkey]["count"]++ occur in finishBuilding() and find a better way to adjust cost (loop through currentBuilding array? - or make a tempCount parameter in the Buildings[building] objects initiallized to 0 and incrimented when a building gets started, decremented what it finished and the cost calculation uses count+tempCount)

2) make research items look better and add option to minimize/hide them - transiton into a small size with an icon/number that you can 
hover over for a tooltip

3) add some new goal like a total population (the coucil has decided that once the town reaches X people they will attempt to start exploring and mapping the surrounding area)

then you can add an explorers guild next to the town hall - rename Town Hall tab?
explorer missions first few to discover places to make more resrouces - can add jobs to fields or forest - discover a coal mine

4) add resources and jobs for metal ores and smelting

5) add a log for statements with a dropdown tab
