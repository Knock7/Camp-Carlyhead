1) fix the food shortage bug. how to deal with this when everyone can't even hunt for food because too many are building or run out of hunter space?

2) add option to minimize/hide research buttons - transiton into a small size with an icon/number that you can 
hover over for a tooltip? for now they just disappear.

3) add some new goal like a total population (the coucil has decided to improve planning, reduce cost ratios of all buildings
then you can add an explorers guild next to the town hall - rename Town Hall tab?
- discover a coal mine
- discover iron mine (adding mines changes the ratio of cu/fe/coal output by the miners so that a given miner, say, produces less cu_ore but now produces some fe_ore

4) Add some jobs to forrest

5) make jobBoxes into two columns

6) resource rate of change span and stored tabbed (inline boxes with fixed width for resource names)

7) tech to reduce all cost ratios

8) exploring takes an additional 3% food per trip

9) win message for 10 cu and 4 kilns, put work 'win' in the message (can change way the alert box appears?)

10) fix tooltip text for cu_ore

11) fix workshop tooltip text to add brickmakers

12) have a way to store more food and get more people (cabin for families to move into - kids number to Camp box (they eat less food and don't do jobs/do other easy jobs)

13) implement coal and iron mines

14) make kilns be able to select which metals are smelted 

15) add in trading for gold and other resources - later add in gold mine but not until after the market is set up

16) need some distant insentive that will require research -> want more researchers -> need more income -> need more workers -> need more houses

Pottery
more storage (food, wood, lumber) - maybe increase warehouse space? add silos.

Thoughts from Matt:
Make unlocking woodshed more straightforward
